1)  In BST, ALL the KEYS to LEFT of a Node must be STRICTLY LESS than the it's own key and ALL the KEYS
    to the RIGHT of it must be STRICTLY GREATER than it's own key. [IMPORTANT - This must be true for 
    ALL THE KEYS]
2)  In BST, there must be NO DUPLICATION of any key.
3)  In-Order traversal of a BST is always SORTED.
4)  Successor of a key is its closest key value.
